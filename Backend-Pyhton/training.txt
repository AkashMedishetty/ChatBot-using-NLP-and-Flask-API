What About Electric Cars?
Well of course, the obvious solution put forward is electric cars. So what would it be like to own an electric car? In the UK, electric car ownership is increasing, but in the last year, only 1.1% of cars sold in the UK have been electric. That’s tiny. Well the first problem is cost. Electric cars are currently much more expensive than ordinary petrol or diesel cars. So they’re not affordable for everybody. A new Nissan Leaf electric car costs £28,000 – that’s not affordable for most people. Even the cheapest electric car – currently the Renault Zoe costs £18,000. As production increases, this should become less of a problem. And some of this is offset by how cheap electric cars are to run. The charging costs less than filling the tank with petrol or diesel. However, there are also problems with an essential part, an essential component of an electric car – and that is the battery. A battery, BATTERY.
That’s the power cell – it’s the same word for the little power cells that you might put into a torch – or in your mobile phone. That has a battery, which you recharge with electricity regularly, to keep your phone working. So obviously the battery which is needed to run a car is much bigger. And therein lies some of the problems with electric cars. For example, temperature is a problem. If you want to recharge an electric car battery, you’re going to have problems if the weather means that the temperature is less than 5C. Car batteries are made of lithium – and recharging doesn’t work at low temperatures. And if you’re in a country where the temperature goes above 45C – not in the UK of course, but there are countries that experience these high temperatures. Well, if it’s that hot, your battery may never work again, after a spell of hot weather. It damages the battery. That is clearly impractical, it’s not going to work. And if you live in a hot country, the life of your car battery, the length of time that your battery lasts, will be reduced because of the temperature.

Difficulties of Electric Cars
Back to electric cars. Another problem is range, R-A-N-G-E. ‘Range’ here means the distance that the car can cover on a single charge. In the older models of car, then you’d be lucky to get 150 miles out of a single charge. It is getting better – the newer and premium models of electric car can perhaps go 250 miles on a single charge – but that’s only if you don’t go too fast. If you keep accelerating a lot, then it’ll be much less! So range is still a problem. Maybe a solution in the future will be to carry a spare battery and just swap it over. But given that the cost of the battery is the most expensive bit of an electric car – perhaps that’s going to make it unaffordable again. ‘Unaffordable’ means it costs too much money for most people. Car batteries also don’t last very long – even in the right temperature. So you’d have to replace them reasonably frequently. Electric cars are not only more expensive, but they don’t last as long as diesel and petrol cars – so that’s another problem. And as the car gets older, the battery will become less and less efficient – will work less well, and will need charging more often. That’s not good either.
Friends let me put forward my opinion on the topic "Is India ready for Electric Vehicles"?

India is not yet fully ready for Electric vehicles because,

1. We do not have adequate charging stations in India.

2. Production of electric cars is less due to sales are not up to the mark due to the cost, travelling duration on charging, sufficient charging stations etc.

3. People are not so interested to buy due to safety factors as in the recent past, many electric vehicles caught fire.

Hence, if we strengthen the above points India will definitely be ready for electric vehicles.


India will be ready for electric vehicles or not depends on many factors:

IF WE LOOK FOR AN ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE WE NEED ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

So, it helps to reduce pollution emissions and at the global and political level, it helps reduce the dependence of fuel on other nations.

But I want to add one more thing to popularize electric vehicles among Indians we have to strengthen ourselves in electric power stations.

And we should do more research on how we improvised the electric battery so it covers more destinations with less battery usage.

And electric companies also work on the security and safety of an electric vehicle because it works as a hindrance after all people are disturbed when they hear the news that an electric vehicle got a fire.

So, if we work on this, India will be ready for an electric vehicle.


Electric vehicles are the most suitable alternative for vehicles running on fuel due to many reasons.

1) Hi friends! Coming to the topic, India is ready for electric vehicles we can say yes! Because of the today competitive world most of people moving from one place to another place for their need of survival, so they choose different types of vehicles to move. Whether they may have their own vehicles or public transportation. Almost all vehicles are run with oil like petrol, diesel. Etc. Due to the increasing usage of oil, there is a drastic change in the climate. Due to this, the ozone layer is depleting. By using electric vehicles we can control pollution.

Of course, some of the problems due to battery arises but we can make sure to avoid the problems by taking some measures. Some of the researchers going on that and it can be implemented.

In my view, we are responsible for the environment and we have to save from pollution.

Petrol or diesel are natural resources and they are decreasing day by day and one day it will be finished completely so the need of the time is that we should shift towards others alternative to it like electric Vehicles.

2) The cost of petrol or diesel price also increasing day by day especially in India it is very high and if we talk about electric vehicles then they cost very low in comparison to diesel or petrol.

3) Also, fuel running vehicles create a lot of pollution and because of that we are getting so many diseases and if we look at the condition of our capital city Delhi then it is very difficult for us to breathe in the fresh air. So here the simple way is that we should now shift towards the electric vehicle as they are eco-friendly and do not create pollution.

4) Electric vehicle also saves us from noise pollution because they have very little sound in comparison to fuel running Vehicles.

5) Government has to pay so much taxes for purchasing crude oil from other countries that can also be reduced if we use electric vehicles.
Electric vehicles are the future of India because fuel is less in India than how to travel in India this time EV vehicle are a good choice. Because they consume less electricity and are pollution-free.


To know whether India is ready for electric cars or not people should first know what is electric vehicles. Electric vehicles, unlike conventional petrol and diesel vehicles, use one or more electric motors for propulsion. Electric vehicles have a battery that is charged through an electricity supply. The electric energy is then stored and used to power the electric motor.

According to a report by NITI Aayog,

India can save 64% of anticipated passenger road-based mobility-related energy demand and 37% of carbon emissions in 2030 by pursuing a shared, electric, and connected mobility future.

This would result in a reduction of 156 mega toes in diesel and petrol consumption for that year. At USD 52/bbl of crude, this would imply a net savings of roughly Rs 3.9 lakh crore (approximately 60 billion USD) in 2030. These figures clearly indicate an urgent requirement for the replacement of conventional vehicles with electric vehicles.

While prominent manufacturers such as Maruti Suzuki India, Hero Electric Vehicles, Mahindra and Mahindra are already registered electric manufacturers in India, latest collaborations such as Suzuki and Toyota, are planning to launch electric vehicles in India.

On the same lines, India's first EV manufacturer Mahindra and Mahindra has forged a partnership with Ford to develop electric mobility solutions that are affordable for Indian consumers.

Among the world's 20 most polluted cities in the world, 13 are in India. Vehicular pollution is one of the major contributors to air pollution. India is in a group of countries that has the highest particulate matter (PM) levels. Its cities have the highest levels of PM10 and PM2. 5 (particles with a diameter of 10 microns and 2.5 microns). These figures are six times more than the WHO "safe' limit of 25 micrograms and represent the exigency for Electrical Vehicles.

Electric vehicles are not only Environment Friendly but also Cost Effective as Government is incentivizing the use of Electric Vehicles by providing subsidies and lower motor taxes on EVs. Electric Vehicles are 100 per cent eco-friendly. They do not emit toxic gases or smoke in the environment which leads to global warming and helps to reduce pollution. As electricity is majorly produced from either renewable sources or from sources that emit no greenhouse gases thus EVs help in maintaining energy security by shifting dependence from non-renewable resources to renewable resources. Electric vehicles require less maintenance than conventional vehicles as there are fewer fluids (like oil and transmission fluid) to change and fewer moving parts. Electric vehicles are quieter to operate than gasoline-powered vehicles, leading to a reduction in noise pollution.

So, the answers is YES, India is ready for electric vehicles.


Talking about the need of electic vehicle in India, yes India do require electric vehicle but if we talk about whether India is ready or not. I would like to show the other side of the coin still the major problem which India is facing is electric vehicle required charging and still there are not many such charging stations are avaible. Also, electric vehicle are not having powerful engine as compared to diesel and petrol vehicle and as we all know that India is a land of diversity, bu the term diversity I need to say about its geography as there are hills and mountains where these electric vehicles will not be able to create a good impact. Also, most Indians do prefer diesel and petrol cars as they are not much aware of electric vehicles and the other reasons is still many household don't have charging facility for electric cars and electric stations will charge some money for charging. Here, I would like to draw your attention towards a major problem as a person if I charging the vehvehicle then it will require sometime but for some person time is still a important factor while on the other hand petrol and diesel cars do require money but at the same time they don't require time as compare to electric vehicles. Talking about pollution now eco friendly fuels are been developed that emit less harmful gases as compare to other fuel.

Undoubtedly, India needs an electric vehicle. Today's scenario in Delhi is the best example. Onside India is Trying to recover from 2nd wave of COVID. The other side is air pollution in Delhi. Due to carbon emission in fossil fuels, the area is polluted leads to a lot of acute and chronic diseases. So the central govt made a special rule to undergo lockdown for 20 days. This made people mentally I'll. The other side compulsory use of green vehicles in Delhi to reduce pollution. Yes, India is needed for e-vehicle. Already, Two-wheelers and rickshaws are started manufactured. The reduction of carbon emission by the use of vehicles can be one best solution. Also, the cost of vehicles can be minimized so that middle-class people can afford it. There is noise generation. It can run smoothly. We conclude that e-vehicle is needed for the next coming young generation to prevent the resources from pollution and green earning.
